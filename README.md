this is supposed to be a portfolio, made this in a very un-serious manner
chatgpt is the top contributer of this, I do know html, Css and JS but made this entirely using chatgpt, ws3schools and very little of my own knowledge.
I did edit it according to my own preferences, and I will still keep developing this as I learn and understand more of it as a whole. So yes this is basically my very first stepping stone to the web dev world.
